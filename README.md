# photoQuest

PhotoQuest is a community web app designed to improve photography skills through fun challenges. Moderators or users can create photo quests – themed challenges such as “Golden Hour Cityscape” or “Macro Texture Challenge”. Photographers then submit their photos for each challenge, showcasing their interpretation of the theme. Users can browse the gallery of submissions, leave comments or likes, and learn from others’ techniques. This platform encourages creativity and learning by prompting photographers to step outside their comfort zone and try new ideas, with a supportive community providing feedback and inspiration.
